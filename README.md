# Amount of Stops Calculator for SW Ships

Provision how many stops you will need to make to cover a given distance in MGLT using any of the spaceships available.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the software up and running on your local machine for your use and purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The following requisites are mandatory to run the application:

```
Internet connection
Microsoft Windows 7 or newer (to run the EXE)
Python 3.6.3 or newer (to run it from the source code)
```

### Installing

To run the executable:

```
Download the file "SW Stops Amount.exe" to your computer and run it.
```

To run from the source code, e.g. in Linux:

```
Install Python 3.6.3 or later in your enviroment (https://www.python.org/).
Download the source code and open a shell.
Run the following command, considering that Python is in the PATH and the source was placed in the directory /home/hanssolo:
$ python /home/hanssolo/SW_stops_amount.py 
```

## Running the tests

This software takes advantage from Python's "unittest" library to test itself.

### Break down into end to end tests

To test the application and ensure the it gives a certain expected value, follow these steps:

```
Install Python 3.6.3 or newer on your local machine
Download both python files in the same directory
Execute the file unit_test.py
```

### Coding style tests

The unit test tests only one feature

```
The amount of stops of a single mock starship
```

## Deployment

We recommend you to have python's executables on your PATH variable.
